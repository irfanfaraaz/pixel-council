# Pixel Council

Summon the design wisdom of Apple, Google, Stripe, IBM, and Microsoft. A Claude Code skill that produces production-grade UIs informed by the actual design systems of the world's top tech companies.

## The Problem

AI-generated UIs look AI-generated. Excessive gradients, inconsistent spacing, random colors, missing interaction states, and generic layouts that scream "vibe-coded."

## The Solution

Pixel Council encodes the real design principles, token systems, spacing scales, typography rules, color strategies, and per-component specifications from world-class design teams into a Claude Code skill. When triggered, it guides Claude to build UI the way Apple, Google, and Stripe actually build theirs.

- **Semantic color tokens** instead of random hex values
- **Consistent spacing** from a 4px/8px grid system
- **Proper typography hierarchy** with defined scales
- **All interaction states** (hover, focus, active, disabled, loading, error)
- **Dark mode** from the start
- **Accessibility standards** (WCAG AA contrast, touch targets, keyboard nav)
- **Responsive layouts** that work across screen sizes

## Design Systems Included

| Company | Source | Coverage |
|---------|--------|----------|
| Google | [Material Design 3](https://github.com/material-components/material-web) | 22 component specs, color tokens, typography scale, shape system, elevation, state layers |
| Apple | [Human Interface Guidelines](https://github.com/6639835/apple-hig) | 13 component specs, semantic colors, SF Pro type scale, layout, motion, materials |
| Blended | Best-of-both | 12 component specs combining Google's systematic tokens with Apple's refinement |

*More companies coming: Stripe, IBM, Microsoft, Linear, Vercel, Shopify...*

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shubhamshrivastava/pixel-council.git
cd pixel-council
./install.sh
```

Or manually:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.agents/skills/pixel-council
cp skill/SKILL.md ~/.agents/skills/pixel-council/
cp -r references ~/.agents/skills/pixel-council/
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills
ln -sf ../../.agents/skills/pixel-council ~/.claude/skills/pixel-council
```

Restart Claude Code. Type `/skills` to verify `pixel-council` is listed.

## Usage

```
> /pixel-council Build a settings page with profile info and notification toggles

> /pixel-council Create a card component, Apple style

> /pixel-council Design a dashboard with sidebar, Google Material style
```

It also auto-triggers when you ask Claude to build any UI:

```
> build a login screen
> create a pricing page
> make this look more polished
> design a dashboard with sidebar navigation
```

### Choosing a Design System

| What you say | What happens |
|---|---|
| Just describe the UI | Blended (best of all companies) |
| "Google style" / "Material style" | Pure Google Material Design 3 specs |
| "Apple style" / "iOS style" | Pure Apple HIG specs |
| "Combine Google and Apple" | Reads both, synthesizes |

## Adding More Design Systems

Adding a new company is just a new folder. No skill code changes needed.

1. Create `references/{company}/overview.md` with their design foundations
2. Create `references/{company}/components/` with per-component spec files
3. Submit a PR

## Contributing

Contributions welcome:

- **New design system references** (Stripe, IBM, Microsoft, Linear, Vercel, Shopify)
- **More component specs** for existing companies
- **Framework-specific examples** and patterns
- **Figma resource links** and integration
